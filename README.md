# 💘 💞 💋 OKCupid -Text Analysis & NLP
This ia an EDA project







## 🧰 EDA Motivation and Introduction


Our goal is to make use of a variety of approaches (mostly graphical) to maximize insights of the data set.

Mainly, to extract important interactions between the profiles variables and prefences, detect outliers, and test underlying assumptions whithin the users.

In addition, we aim to preform text analysis to determine optimal pairing (maximun number of matches).
## 🔧	 Tools and Methods

 - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
 - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
 - [Spacy](https://spacy.io/)
 - [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)

## 📑 OkCupid DataSet

OkCupid is a mobile dating app. It sets itself apart from other dating apps by making use of a pre computed compatibility score, calculated by optional questions the users may choose to answer.

In this dataset, there are 60k records containing structured information such as age, sex, orientation as well as text data from open ended descriptions. Permission to use this data set was explicitly granted by OkCupid. The dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/okcupid-profiles)


## ⚙️ Setup
You must download the dataset (it is larger then 25M and can't be uploaded to the repository).
Then move the dataset and the notebook to your google drive, and you're good to go!
